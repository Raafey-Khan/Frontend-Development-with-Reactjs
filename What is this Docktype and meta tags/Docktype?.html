<!--Meta tags dont provide information in the webpage
But they provide piece of information to the webpage to the browser <-- Most Important-->

<!DOCTYPE html>  <!--Starting Boiler plate-->
<html lang="en">  <!--Language English lan=en-->
<head>               <!--head tag and body tag is wrapped in the html tag which is lang=en right seems interesting-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head> <!--head tag is for providing some extra piece of information to your html document
inside the head tag you write title-->
<title>im in the head tag</title>
<body>
    <!--Actual visibility through code and all is in the body -->
    <!--You write all the content of html documents inside the body tag of html-->
</body>
</html>

<!--What is Doctype html ?

Ans - <!DOCTYPE html> actually represents your browser's ,singnals, or signifies your browser that expect an HTML 5 Document
in order to represent that html , and if you want to write not html5 then you can just write

<html> 
    
Doctype Property is actually going to represent to the browser
of what type of html document to expect -- NIce one haha-->

"What is Meta tag"

<!--When you have to send some Extra piece of information
like there is SEO (Search Engine Otimization) that google does ranking to 
get your web page on the top when you  hit for some request for website's to google

so in (SEO) Search Engine Optimization we generally use 
Keywords, and based on keywords our website search engine is optimized

you can also represet what will we will write in html code

than for responsive we can see like
<meta name = "viewport" content = "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
