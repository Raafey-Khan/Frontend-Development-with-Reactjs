what package json will does

package.json will give the meta data about your project


What i mean about the meta data ?

1) who this project is prepared for
2) what are the dependencies  
3) scripts configuration

bunch of metadata


but 



in packagelock.json


you'll gonna find
dependent of dependencies


and package.json will give major dependencies





why json called javascript objection notation ?

cause it looks like js objects
but not actaully a javascript lol
