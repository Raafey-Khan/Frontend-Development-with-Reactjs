// There are two types of Equality Operators


//  ==    :-  Abstract Equality Operator ( double equals )

// ===    :- Strict Equality Operator ( triple  equals )



// Myth

// abstract equality doest checks type

// strict equality checks type

// Truth as per the official documentation of ecmascript International

// Abstract Equality Operator and Strict Equality Operator both check the Type.

// But what they do well it depends.
