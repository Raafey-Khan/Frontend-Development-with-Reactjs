// -0 is used for finding direction, for example at some point of time we have to analyze the 
// directional velocity, so using -0 we can get the direction from negative to positive
// Numbers: - -0, NaN, Infinity
// NAN (Not A Number) :- Used to show invalid numbers


console.log(10 / null); //A number reaches Infinity when it exceeds the upper limit for a number

console.log(undefined / null) //Bro your trying to divide, but its invalid situation, undefined cannot be divided cause its not definded yet


console.log(+0)
console.log(-0)
console.log(NaN)
console.log(Infinity) //Very large value
console.log(-Infinity) //valid number but for large values
