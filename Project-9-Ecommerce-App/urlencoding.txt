if you see any kind of like apostrophy

like space 


!

"

&

() any kind of character the url is encoded in percentage like


lets say space 


character               From Windows-1252            From UTF-8

Space                       %20                          %20


'                            %27                        %27


so as in the categories we populate categories

like forEach(categories => {
    and here we passed in the href

    CategoryItem.href = `productList.html?category={categories}`

    and like from here we are making the categoriescome up in url encoding

    so if space it will show %20
    and if there is like ' then it will show %27

    thats why in the mens category it is shwoing

    /productList.html?category=men%27s%20clothing   // url encoded way
    its just like /productList.html?category=men's clothing // normal way
})
