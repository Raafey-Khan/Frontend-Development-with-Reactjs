    <!--HTMl elements has an attribute called style, we can use style attribute to render inline css in html elements-->

<!--If you go to color picker you will see a color picker and it is in HEX ( HEXADECIMAL code) and the code changes as the color pixels changes
and fun part is when you write the name color directly like gold white black
there's a box before the color name than in that box you can see color
represented automatically in rgb(form) / Hexcode / HSV and more when you clck the color backend code you can say a power of vscode hahah-->


<!--Rgb stands for (Red, Green, Blue)-->
<!--Rgba stands for (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)-->


<!--The alpha channel is also measured on a scale from 0 to 255, where 0 is fully transparent (completely see-through), and 255 is fully opaque (completely solid)-->


<!--Best part of it internally css are saperated by -> (;))-->
