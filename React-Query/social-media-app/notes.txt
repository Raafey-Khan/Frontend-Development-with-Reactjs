What is a Query?

A query is a declarative dependency on a asynchronous source of data that
is tied to unique key. A query can be used with any Promise 
based method (including GET and POST methods) to fetch data from 
a server if our method modifies data on the server, we recommended
using Muataions instead.

useQuery - we use useQuery to fetch data from the server

useMuatations - we use UseMutations in order to modifies data on ther server


How useQuery works
first argument unique key
second argument a function returning promise
