/* Why to use box model you got a question right so

ans)  The meaning of content box and Border box is

       You can actually figure out whether you want to 
       include - Padding and The Border Width in your given width or not*/

       /* So width is consider as padding and border width and overall is 100% to the content is border
       
       and  in the content box model the width is calculated + padding + border-width */


/*Summary - 
1) box-sizing: content:box(default) / border-box
2)  p{width: 100%} - 
content box- the content gets 100% of the width and the padding , border overflows out of the box
border-box- here the whole box including border gets 100% of the width
3) image illustration of content box vs border box - https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/widthbox.png?w=367&amp;ssl=1 */



/* CONTENT-BOX = Content-box for remember = the default.
and  Width and Height valeus apply to the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the outside of the box*/


/* PADDING-BOX = padding-box: Width and height values apply to the element's content and its
   padding. The border is added to the outside of the box, Currently, only Firefox supports
   the padding-box value */


/* BORDER-BOX = Border-box: Width and Height values apply to the content, padding, and border,*/

/* INHERIT = inherit: inherits the box sizing of the parent element */



/* The Optimal way to write box model is */

/* Every time before start writing the css */
html{
    box-sizing: border-box;

}

*, *::before, *::after{
    box-sizing: inherit;
