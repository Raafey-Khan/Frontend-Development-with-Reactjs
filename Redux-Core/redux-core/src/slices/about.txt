slice is a portion or part of the redux store that is responsible

for managing a specific peice of state.


--> for example: todoSlice will maintain everything about todoSlice
i.e. initial state, actions, reducers


--> userSlice will maintain everything about users i.e. initial state,
reducers, etc

all at one place
